## Let's Encrypt: Order a certificate {#purchaseLetsencryptCertificate}

<%= render "v2-preview-endpoint" %>

    POST /:account/domains/:domain/certificates/letsencrypt

Purchase a [Let's Encrypt](https://dnsimple.com/letsencrypt) certificate with DNSimple.

The certificate itself is **free**, but some features of the certificate may require higher tier plans.

<note>
The domain must be [delegated](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/pointing-domain-to-dnsimple/) to DNSimple.
</note>

### Certificate name

The default certificate name is `www` and covers both the root domain (e.g. `example.com`) and the `www` subdomain (e.g. `www.example.com`).

You can choose a **custom name** (like `api`), which is valid only for `https://api.example.com`.
Custom names require a subscription to a Teams or Enterprise plan.

### Alternate names

A certificate can be purchased for multiple subdomains. We call them _alternate names_ or [Subject Alternative Name (SAN)](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-ssl-san/).

By default, a certificate doesn't have alternate names.

You can purchase a single certificate for both `https://docs.example.com` and `https://status.example.com`, alongside  `https://example.com`.

Alternate names require a subscription to a Teams or Enterprise plan.

### Wildcard certificates

To request a wildcard certificate that's valid for an unlimited number of names that belong to a single subdomain level, use `*` (e.g. `*.example.com`).

<info>
Let's Encrypt wildcard certificates is a feature that is only available to the Teams or Enterprise plans.
If the feature is not enabled, you will receive an HTTP 412 response code.
</info>

### Auto renewal

By default, a certificate isn't auto-renewed when it expires.

Certificates with auto-renewal disabled may be [renewed manually](#purchaseRenewalLetsencryptCertificate).

You may also **purchase the certificate once** and select the auto-renewal option. With auto-renewal enabled, our system automatically renews a certificate before it expires. Notifications for renewed certificates are sent via email, and a webhook is fired when a new certificate is available. You'll still have to install the renewed certificate.

### Signature algorithm

By default, a certificate uses `ECDSA` signature algorithm, but `RSA` can be used as well if your specific scenario required it.

### Parameters

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`:account` | `integer` | The account id
`:domain` | `string`, `integer` | The domain name or id

### Example

Purchase a Let's Encrypt certificate for `bingo.pizza` in the account `1010`:

    curl  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \

          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
          -X POST \
          -d '<json>' \
          https://api.dnsimple.com/v2/1010/domains/bingo.pizza/certificates/letsencrypt


### Input

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`auto_renew` | `bool` | Set to true to enable the auto-renewal of the certificate. Default: `false`.

`alternate_names` | `array<string>` | The certificate _alternate names_. Default: `[]`. Example: `["docs.example.com", "status.example.com"]`
`signature_algorithm` | `string` | Optional string to determine the signature algorithm to be used. Either `ECDSA` or `RSA`, defaults to `ECDSA`.
