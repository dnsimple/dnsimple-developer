# Overview

This page provides an overview of the official DNSimple API v2.

## URL

All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from the `api.dnsimple.com` domain.

In order to maintain compatibility in the future, all requests must specify an API version, which is appended to the URL.

    https://api.dnsimple.com/v2/

## Testing

We maintain a separate environment for testing called [Sandbox accounts](/sandbox/). Sandbox API calls must use the `api.sandbox.dnsimple.com` domain.

<note>
Please use Sandbox for testing your API integration, **before using production**. Also note we will not refund you charges on your production account as a result of wrong API calls.
</note>

## Current Version

The current API version is `v1`. `v2` is in public beta and ready for production usage.


## Authentication

There two ways to authenticate through DNSimple API: the **HTTP Basic Authentication** and the **OAuth2 token**.

When you create an OAuth2 token programmatically, the token is scoped to the specific account granted during the OAuth2 dance. When you create an OAuth2 token from the application, you can create either an user token or an account token. The user token gives you access to any resource associated to any account the user has access to. Conversely, an account token gives you access only to the resources connected to that account.

The HTTP Basic Authentication always authenticate you as an user.

##### HTTP Basic Authentication

~~~
curl -u 'EMAIL:PASSWORD' https://api.dnsimple.com/v2/whoami
~~~

Users with two-factor authentication enabled must send an extra HTTP header for the request.

~~~
curl -u 'EMAIL:PASSWORD' -H "X-Dnsimple-OTP: 2FA-TOKEN" https://api.dnsimple.com/v2/whoami
~~~

In case two-factor authentication is enabled but the header is not sent, the application will respond with a `401` and a response header: `X-Dnsimple-OTP: required`.

##### OAuth2 Token

~~~
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer OAUTH-TOKEN' https://api.dnsimple.com/v2/whoami
~~~

Note that Oauth2 tokens cam be acquired [programmatically and via OAuth dance](/v2/oauth/) or can be generated from the user/account sections in the DNSimple application.

## Response Codes

DNSimple uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of an API request.

### Successful

- `200 OK` - Everything worked as expected.
- `201 Created` - The request was successful and a resource was created. This is typically a response from a POST request to create a resource, such as the registration of a Domain or the creation of a Contact.
- `202 Accepted` - The request has been accepted for processing. This is typically a response from a POST request that is handled async in our system, such as a Domain transfer request.
- `204 No Content` - The request was successful but the response body is empty. This is typically a response from a DELETE request to delete a resource.

### Error

- `400 Bad Request` - A required parameter or the request is invalid.
- `401 Unauthorized` - The authentication credentials are invalid.
- `402 Payment Required` - Your account is not subscribed or not in good standing.
- `404 Not Found` - The requested resource doesn't exist.
- `429 Too Many Requests` - You exceeded the allowed number of requests per hour and your request has temporarily been throttled.

### Kaboom!

- `500`, `502`, `503`, `504 Server errors` - something went wrong on DNSimple's end.

## Responses

All successful responses will be returned as a JSON object with at least one key: `data`.

The `data` element will contain either a single JSON object or a list of JSON objects, depending on the endpoint.

~~~json
{
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "first_name": "Jane",
    "last_name": "Smith"
  }
}
~~~

## Errors

Error responses will be returned as a JSON object with at least a `message` key. For example, failure to authenticate would result in a 401 response with a body like this:

~~~json
{"message":"Authentication failed"}
~~~

## Pagination

Any API endpoint that returns a list of items requires pagination. By default we will return 30 records from any listing endpoint.

If an API endpoint returns a list of items, then it will include a `pagination` object that contains pagination information.

The `pagination` object contains the following details:

- `current_page`: The page currently returned (default: 1)
- `per_page`: The number of entries returned per page (default: 30)
- `total_entries`: The total number of entries available in the entire collection
- `total_pages`: The total number of pages available given the current `per_page` value

For example:

~~~json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "first_name": "Jane",
      "last_name": "Smith"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Smith",
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "current_page": 1,
    "per_page": 30,
    "total_entries": 2,
    "total_pages": 1
  }
}
~~~

You may include the following arguments as query parameters when you call an API endpoint that supports pagination:

- `page`: The page to return (default: 1)
- `per_page`: The number of entries to return per page (default: 30)

For example:

    https://api.dnsimple.com/v2/_/domains?per_page=100&page=2

## Sorting

API v2 results are implicitly sorted according to policies that vary from endpoint to endpoint.

You can decide your own sorting policy for each single API call via the `sort` parameter.

This parameter accepts a set of comma separated key-value pairs: the name of a field and the order criteria (`asc` for ascending and `desc` for descending).

The order of fields is relevant, as it will determine the priority of the sorting policies.

### Example

List all domains for the account 1010 sorting them by expiration date (asc) and id (desc)

    curl  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
          -H 'Accept: application/json' \
          https://api.dnsimple.com/v2/1010/domains?sorting=expires_on:asc,id:desc

## Rate limiting

There is a limit to the number of requests that you can perform per hour.

- For **authenticated requests** you can make **up to 2400 requests per hour**.
- For **unauthenticated requests**, you can make **up to 30 requests per hour**.

You can see your current rate limit status by checking the HTTP headers of any API request:

~~~
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS-TOKEN" -I "https://api.dnsimple.com/v2/whoami"

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 11 Dec 2015 11:15:42 GMT
Status: 200 OK
Connection: close
X-RateLimit-Limit: 2400
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 2399
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1449836141
~~~

The headers have all the information you need to know about your current rate limit status:

| **Header** | **Description** |
|------------|-----------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | The maximum number of requests you can perform per hour. |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window. |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | The time at which the current rate limit window in [Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) format. |

Once you go over the rate limit you will receive an error response:

~~~
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS-TOKEN" -I "https://api.dnsimple.com/v2/whoami"

HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
X-Ratelimit-Limit: 2400
X-Ratelimit-Remaining: 0
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1449836141
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 28

{"message":"quota exceeded"}
